### Transformations
  * Take raw data and make it easier to understand.  Pre-process data into correct format with only numerical values.

### Clustering Algorithms
  * Group similar objects into clusters. For example, if a cable service wants to group those with similar viewing habits, we would use a clustering algorithm.
