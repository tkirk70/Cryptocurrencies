OSU Module 18 - Unsupervised Machine Learning

### Transformations
  * Take raw data and make it easier to understand.  Pre-process data into correct format with only numerical values.

### Clustering Algorithms
  * Group similar objects into clusters. For example, using a PCA model.


### Preparing Data
  - Data Selection - making good choices about which data will be used.
  - Data Processing - organizing the data by formatting, cleaning, and sampling it.
  - Data Transformation - transforming our data into a simpler format for storage and future use, such as a CSV, spreadsheet, or database file.
